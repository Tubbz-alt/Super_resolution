# Enhancing resolution of micro-CT images of reservoir rocks using super resolution

Contributors: Bochao Zhao, Nishank Saxena, Ronny Hofmann, Chaitanya Pradhan, and Amie Hows

Implementation of super resolution algorithm SRGAN and EDSR for microCT image super resolution.
The architectures are described in the following papers:

EDSR (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02921)

SRGAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802)

Some code in this repository is modified from the repository "Collection of Super-Resolution models via PyTorch" (https://github.com/togheppi/pytorch-super-resolution-model-collection)

A tutorial of the code named Tutorial.ipynb is included.
